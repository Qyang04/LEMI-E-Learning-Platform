                <br>
                <p>
                    We believe that excessive standardization, over-emphasis on test scores, and lack of innovation in the education system have had highly damaging outcomes that have negatively impacted the learners of the world.
                    ‚ÄúChange‚Äù allows us to evolve beyond our current limitations and forces us to find new ways of thinking and solving problems in the ways we can help the learners learn better.
